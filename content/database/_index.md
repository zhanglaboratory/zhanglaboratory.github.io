**Full Title:** *KICDB: A Causality-Oriented Multi-Omics Database for Kinase Inhibitor-Induced Cardiotoxicity*

**Authors:** Jiamin Wei, Yin Liu, Miaoqing Wu, Guoyuan Li, Xinyao Zheng, Huafeng Fu, Jian Zhang, Jijin Lin

**Abstract:**
* **Background:** Kinase inhibitors (KIs) are mainstays of targeted cancer therapy, but their clinical utility is frequently limited by cardiotoxicity. A systematic resource to explore the underlying causal mechanisms is urgently needed.
* **Methods:** We present the KICDB, a comprehensive and interactive web server built upon a framework integrating large-scale transcriptomics meta-analysis with causal inference.
* **Results:** This database centralizes the findings from a comprehensive meta-analysis of 26 kinase inhibitors (KIs) across 7 studies (n=5291) identified 8,907 significant gene expression changes in human cardiomyocytes.
* **Conclusions:** KICDB serves as a valuable and accessible platform for the cardio-oncology community.
