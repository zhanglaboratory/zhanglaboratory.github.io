Our research is supported by the **National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)** and focuses on three strategic pillars:

### 1. Precision GI Oncology & Surgery
* **Minimally Invasive Surgery:** Optimizing robotic and laparoscopic techniques for gastric and colorectal cancer.
* **Clinical Translation:** Improving patient outcomes through biomarker-guided surgical strategies.

---

### 2. Non-coding RNA & Epigenetics
* **Mechanistic Study:** Investigating the roles of **lncRNAs** (e.g., *GHRLOS*, *FAL1*) and **alternative splicing** in tumor metastasis and chemoresistance.
* **Ferroptosis:** Exploring NPR1-regulated ferroptosis pathways in gastric cancer.

### 3. Nanomedicine & Drug Delivery
* **Targeted Therapy:** Developing **biomimetic nanoparticles** for precise drug delivery.
* **Cardio-Oncology:** utilizing the **KICDB** database to mitigate kinase inhibitor-induced cardiotoxicity.
